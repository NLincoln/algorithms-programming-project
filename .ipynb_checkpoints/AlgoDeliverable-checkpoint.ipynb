    "The most important piece of information to keep in mind is that we only need to consider the two outermost coins on the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "The side-picking algorithm finds the maximum valued coin in the outermost coins it's considering. If this maximum value is on the outside of the row, then we simply select the side that the coin is on. Otherwise, we select the other side, so as to \"block\" the other player from being able to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My original algorithm\n",
    "My original algorithm looked at the difference between the outer element and the inner element for each side, and chose the side where this difference was greater. This worked for the first four inputs, but failed on the last one. So I brute-forced to find the six numbers that the final test needed to sum to a value of 148. I then worked backwards from those six numbers to figure out an algorithm that could produce them. That algorithm is described below"
